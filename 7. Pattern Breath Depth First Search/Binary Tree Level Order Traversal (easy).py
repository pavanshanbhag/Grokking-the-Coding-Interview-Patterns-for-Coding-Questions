Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its level-by-level traversal.
You should populate the values of all nodes of each level from left to right in separate sub-arrays.

"""
Time complexity 
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. 
This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.

Space complexity 
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. 
We will also need O(N) space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of N/2 nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), 
therefore we will need O(N) space to store them in the queue.


Here are some edge cases to consider:
An empty binary tree
A binary tree with only one node
A binary tree with multiple levels and different number of nodes at each level
