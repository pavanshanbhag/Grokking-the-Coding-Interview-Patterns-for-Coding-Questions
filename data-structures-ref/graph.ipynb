    "### Efficiency of Using `defaultdict` vs. Linked List-Based Adjacency List\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of using a `defaultdict` versus a linked list-based adjacency list depends on the specific use case and operations performed on the graph. Here are some key points to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `defaultdict` (Graph):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: Efficient in terms of space for sparse graphs, as it only stores edges that exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - **Adding an Edge**: O(1) for both directed and undirected graphs.\n",
    "  - **Accessing Neighbors**: O(1) for accessing the list of neighbors of a vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ease of Use**: Simple to implement and use, leveraging Python's built-in data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Linked List-Based Adjacency List (Graph with `AdjNode`):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: Also efficient for sparse graphs, but each edge requires additional space for the `AdjNode` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - **Adding an Edge**: O(1) for both directed and undirected graphs.\n",
    "  - **Accessing Neighbors**: O(1) for accessing the head of the linked list, but iterating through neighbors is O(E) where E is the number of edges for that vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ease of Use**: Slightly more complex to implement due to the need to manage linked list nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Efficiency**: Both are efficient for sparse graphs, but `defaultdict` might use slightly less memory as it avoids the overhead of `AdjNode` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Efficiency**: Both have O(1) time complexity for adding edges and accessing neighbors. However, iterating through neighbors in a linked list might be slightly slower due to pointer dereferencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implementation Complexity**: `defaultdict` is simpler and more straightforward to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "For most practical purposes, using a `defaultdict` is more efficient and simpler to implement. It provides the same time complexity benefits while being easier to manage and understand. The linked list-based approach might be useful in scenarios where you need to perform more complex operations on the adjacency list nodes themselves.\n"
