    "## Disjoint Set (Union-Find) Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "- **Disjoint Set**: This is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.\n",
    "- **Union-Find**: This is another name for the same data structure, emphasizing its two primary operations: union and find.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "- **Find**: Determines which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for checking if two elements are in the same subset.\n",
    "- **Union**: Joins two subsets into a single subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizations\n",
    "- **Path Compression**: This optimization helps keep the tree flat by making nodes point directly to the root.\n",
    "- **Union by Rank/Size**: This optimization helps keep the tree balanced by always attaching the smaller tree under the root of the larger tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "- **Network Connectivity**: To determine if two nodes are in the same connected component.\n",
    "- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: For finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Connectivity**: To manage a dynamic set of elements partitioned into disjoint sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Union by Rank\n",
    "- **Rank**: This heuristic uses the concept of the \"rank\" of a tree, which is an upper bound on the height of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Union by Rank\n",
    "- When performing a union operation, the root of the tree with the smaller rank is made a child of the root of the tree with the larger rank.\n",
    "- If the ranks are equal, one tree becomes the child of the other, and the rank of the new root is incremented by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Union by Size\n",
    "- **Size**: This heuristic uses the size of the tree, which is the number of elements in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Union by Size\n",
    "- When performing a union operation, the root of the smaller tree (in terms of the number of elements) is made a child of the root of the larger tree.\n",
    "- This helps keep the tree balanced and shallow."
