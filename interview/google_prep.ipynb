    "To solve this problem, we can use the greedy approach. We can start by sorting the meetings based on their start times. Then, we can iterate through \n",

    "\n",
    "To implement this approach, we can use a priority queue to sort the meetings based on their start times. We can also use another priority queue to \n",
    "keep track of the end times of the meetings assigned to each room. This will allow us to quickly check if there is any room available for a new \n",

    "Final Explaination :\n",
    "This is an implementation of the classical algorithm for scheduling meetings optimally, \n",
    "using a priority queue (min heap) to keep track of the end times of the meetings in progress. The basic idea is to allocate a new room \n",
    "for each new meeting that overlaps with the meetings already scheduled in all the existing rooms. If a meeting can be scheduled without \n",
    "the need for a new room, it is assigned to one of the already allocated rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm sorts the meetings in ascending order of their start times to ensure that earlier meetings are scheduled before later ones. \n",
    "Then, it initializes an empty schedule and an empty min heap. The min heap is used to keep track of the end times of the meetings in \n",
    "progress. Each element in the heap is a tuple containing the end time of a meeting and the index of the room in which it is scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm then iterates over the sorted meetings, checking whether any room is free at the start time of each meeting. If a room is free, \n",
    "the meeting is scheduled in that room and its end time is added to the min heap. If no room is free, a new room is allocated for the meeting, \n",
    "and its end time is added to the min heap. The index of the room to which the meeting is assigned is stored in the schedule list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the algorithm returns the schedule list and the number of rooms used. The resulting schedule is a list of lists, where each inner list \n",
    "represents a room and contains the meetings scheduled in that room.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this implementation is O(nlogn) because the meetings are sorted before processing and adding to the heap is an O(logn) operation. \n",
    "The space complexity is O(n) because the heap and schedule both require additional space proportional to the number of meetings.\n",
